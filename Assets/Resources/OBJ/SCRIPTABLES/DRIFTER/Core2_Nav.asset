  ItemName: Gubernator Chambers
  ItemDesc: 'The candles and strings that surround the Drifter''s steering equipment
    allow a Gubernator to feel the vibrations around the Drifter as if they had become
    one with it. It is from here that the vessel is navigated. When the Chambers
    are destroyed, hull damage taken by the Drifter is heavily increased, as it slips
    into the Mist more easily. The Chambers take reduced damage from enemy bombardment.
