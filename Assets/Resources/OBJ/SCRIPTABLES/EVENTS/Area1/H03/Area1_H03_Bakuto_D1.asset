  StoryTexts:
  - BaseText: It rains during the night. Forced downward to avoid the roiling clouds,
      your vessel moves forward slowly.

    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: It stays quiet for a while. Your crew huddles together and prepares
      to sleep, until your Gubernator gives a shout from the Communopathy chambers,
      having detected a rapidly approaching vessel.

  - BaseText: They are the <color=red>Bakuto Clan</color>. You have heard of their
      rise from news during the Starlight Endeavour. Previously only an organized
      crime syndicate, their fleets have apparently grown massive enough to rival
      the Invictus home fleets.

      towards us in a straight line.

  - BaseText: Vessel of the <color=magenta>Starlight Endeavour</color>. You have
      come far enough. If you are not Logipedan, choose a god and say your prayers.

  - BaseText: In steel and in fire, you shall be sent to the Ash Wastes. It is a
      shame that you will thus not witness the <color=red>Iron Throne's</color> victory
      over <color=yellow>Capitolis</color>.
