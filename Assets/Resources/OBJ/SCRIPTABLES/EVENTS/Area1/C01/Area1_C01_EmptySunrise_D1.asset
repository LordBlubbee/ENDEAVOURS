  - BaseText: Your team loots a small surplus of resources from the camp. Loot includes
      playing cards- they are utilized to play a Nomaden card game, said to have
      originated from before the Nebula, known as "Poker".
    VariantTexts:
    - The camp is abandoned. A wrecked Loon once operated by a civilian from a frontier
      Executis is located, and its hull is stripped for materials and supplies.
    - A Flux radio is found, and frequencies listed on a paper note are tried. There
      are no responses. The supply camp must have been of Logipedan origin as a relief
      point for travellers.
