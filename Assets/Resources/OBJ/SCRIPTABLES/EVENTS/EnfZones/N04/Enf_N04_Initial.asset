  - BaseText: Our dearest, dearest greetings to you, unaffiliated vessel... This
      here is a research vessel, by the will of the Nebula, we have been sent to

  - BaseText: A large number of Nomaden visitors are on-board their Drifter. They
      were in the middle of a religious ceremony when we arrived. No doubt the Ephemerals

      extremist religion.

  - BaseText: They are sitting on an abundance of resources, and their vessel must
