  StoryTexts:
  - BaseText: Our Drifter descends over valleys and large specks of terrain. Different
      signs and small Loons populate the area, and our team is wary to see their
      allegiance or possible courses of action.

    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: b7316e420e6b33e41999ba092b1fe073, type: 2}
    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: It seems that the Drifters in this area belong to a multitude of different
      peoples- most of them refugees who fear the Pragmaticus. They are wary of our
      presence, and more than one weapon is raised towards us as we approach the
      camps in the center.

    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Here, we find many gathered peoples, eating dinners while sat in circles.
      A speaker is sent down to join them and explain our peaceful intentions. However,
      they are caught in the midst of fervent discussion, and many potentially dangerous
      faces.

  - BaseText: A representative of the <color=green>Coalition</color> has arrived.
      They argue that people must not be scared. They explain that they believe that
      the Pragmaticus mean no harm, but that their methods are ancient. They explain
      that the people here can use their vessel to evacuate some people who don't
      wish to be sent to the Logipedan Executiis.

  - BaseText: A trio of suit-wearing <color=red>Bakuto Clan</color> members argue
      against the Coalitionists, explaining that the Clans need to work together
      to resist the Pragmaticus through violence if they are to keep their freedoms.

      nearby. We must make a decision soon.
