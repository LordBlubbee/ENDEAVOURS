  - BaseText: We are a Coalition vessel and are in need of food and fuel to bring
      our people to safety. We possess Ephemeral-made technology with which we might
      part as a payment for your assistance. Please assist!...

    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: The Coalition has indeed sent relief vessels to assist the stricken
      Nomaden here, but it remains an awkward arrangement. The Republic and Coalition
      are supposed to be staunch allies, and yet, their individual vessels often
      stand opposed to the Pragmaticus.

  - BaseText: Ephemeral-made gear is nothing to scoff at, though. Their humanitarian
      efforts might have gone through Coalition channels into this area. We have
      a lot to gain there- more so than the obvious benefit of doing a great deed.
