  - BaseText: Lights are found in the distance. A massive Pragmaticus semirigid armed
      to the teeth hovers menacingly over a small office building. People are working
      the fields, and it seems to be a self-sustaining settlement.

  - BaseText: Do you have your copy of the Stipulations on you? During audit, food
      and supplies will be provided to your crew. However, you are to pay a toll
      of ammunition to pass this checkpoint, especially with the armament you display,
      which I hypothesize as level-3.

  - BaseText: Though an inspection is fine, the Pragmaticus are weary and expecting
      trouble. If we are arrested, we lose valuable time. We must move carefully,
      lest to anger the massive warship.
