  - BaseText: Lights are found in the distance. A massive Pragmaticus semirigid armed
      to the teeth hovers menacingly over a small office building. People are working

  - BaseText: Do you have your copy of the Stipulations on you, as instructed? During
      audit, food and supplies will be provided to your crew. However, you are to
      pay a toll of ammunition to pass this checkpoint, especially with the armament
      you display, which I hypothesize as level-3.

  - BaseText: Though an inspection is fine, the Pragmaticus are weary and expecting
      trouble. If we are arrested, we lose valuable time. We must move carefully,
      lest to anger the massive warship.
