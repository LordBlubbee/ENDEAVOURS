  StoryTexts:
  - BaseText: We are entering a new area. A combination of storms, a lack of resources,
      and its very far position have made it almost completely uncharted.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9d5807a3bec7ac546807c3709018eaf7, type: 2}
    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Apparently, it lies right above a place that was once the Sea. Some
      Logipedan excavators extract drinking water here.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9d5807a3bec7ac546807c3709018eaf7, type: 2}
    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Due to the low density of important strategic resources, it is likely
      to be mostly abandoned.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9d5807a3bec7ac546807c3709018eaf7, type: 2}
    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Flux channels are static. Some Nebuloid are detected to live in the
      area. We do not expect much activity here.

    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Or at least, that is our conjecture. Local Nomaden tribes might have
      moved here after conflicts drove them out of the richer regions.

    Alternatives: []
  - BaseText: Though materials or technology are hard to come by here, we should
      use these regions to gather all supplies we can.
